Keybinds files are in the saves/<save>/ folder, named `keybinds`
I use the same format for my block config files, not that it's important tho
They're formatted as follows

:COMMAND=KEY;

ex.
:MOVE_LEFT=A;
:MOVE_RIGHT=D;

These are generated by default based on resources/default_keybinds or if you set them to custom values in settings, based on that

If you really want, you can write your own file and put it in a save file, there's nothing stopping you, but I don't know why you'd do it
